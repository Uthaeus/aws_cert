CloudFront

Edge Locations
    -The location where content will be cached
    -This is separate to an AWS region or availability zone
Origin
    -The origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute
    -This can either be an s3 bucket, EC2 instance, Elastic Load Balancer, or Route53
Distribution
    -The name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations 
        -Web Distribution
            -typically used for websites
        -RTMP
            -used for media streaming

-Edge Locations are not just READ only, you can write to them too 
    -ie: put an object in them 
-Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (time to live)
-You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged 
    -do this by using Invalidations 

GET intensive workloads
    -Use CloudFront content delivery service to get best performance 
    -CloudFront will cache your most frequently accessed objects and will reduce latency for your GET requests 

Mixed Request Type workloads 
    -The key names you use for your objects can impact performance 
    -S3 uses the key name to determine which partition an object will be stored
    -The use of sequential key names 
    -For heavy workloads this can cause I/O issues and contention
    -By using a random prefix to keynames, you can force s3 to distribute your keys across multiple partitions, distributing the I/O workload
