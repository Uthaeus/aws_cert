CD - Continuous Delivery/Deployment

CI & CD are best practices for software development and deployment 
    -They enable frequent software changes to be applied while maintaining system and service stability 
    -Companies like AWS, Netflix, Google, and Facebook have pioneered this approach to releasing code, successfully applying thousands of changes per day
    Devs --> Code Repo --> Build Management --> Test Framework

-Continuous Delivery 
    -Is a development practice where merged changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release into staging and eventually production environments

-Continuous Integration
    -Is about integrating or merging the code changes frequently
    -At least once per day 
    -Enables multiple devs to work on the same application 

-Continuous Delivery
    -Is about automating the build, test, and deployment 
-Continuous Deployment 
    -Fully automates the entire release process
    -Code is deployed into production as soon as it has successfully passed through the release pipeline
