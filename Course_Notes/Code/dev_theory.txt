Dev Theory 


Continuous Integration
    -is about integrating or merging the code changes frequently
        -at least once per day 
    -enables multiple devs to work on the same app 

Continuous Delivery 
    -is all about automating the build, test, and deployment functions

Continuous Deployment 
    -fully automates the entire release process 
        -code is deployed into production as soon as it has successfully passed through the release pipeline 

CodeCommit 
    -Source Control service 
CodeBuild
    -Compile source code 
    -Run tests
    -Package code 
CodeDeploy
    -Automated deployment to EC2, On Premises systems, and Lambda
CodePipeline
    -CI/CD workflow tool 
    -Fully automates the entire release process 
        (build, test, deployment)

*Remember the different types of deployment approach
    -In-Place or Rolling update
        -You stop the application on each host and deploy the latest code 
        -EC2 and On Premises systems only
        -To roll back you must re-deploy the previous version of the application 

    -Blue/Green
        -New instances are provisioned and the new application is deployed to these new instances 
        -Traffic is routed to the new instances according to your own schedule
        -Supported for EC2, On Premises systems, and Lambda functions 
        -Roll back is easy, just route the traffic back to the original instances 
        -Blue is the active deployment 
        -Green is the new release
