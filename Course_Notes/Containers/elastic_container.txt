Elastic Container Service - ECS 


-Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated environments
-Containers have everything the software needs to run 
    -Libraries, system tools, code, etc 
-Containers are created from a read-only template called an Image

ECS 
    -Amazon's managed EC2 container service 
    -Allows you to manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances 
    -Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes 
    -Containers are created from a read-only template called an image 
    -An Image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container 
    -Images are stored in a registry such as AWS ECR 
    -Amazon EC2 Container Registry is a managed AWS Docker registry service 
    -A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS 
    -Task definitions are text files in JSON format that describe one or more containers that form your application 
    -Think of a task definition as a cloud formation template, but for Docker 
        -Configure things such as the amount of CPU, RAM, etc 

-An Amazon ECS service allows you to run and maintain a specified number (or, the desired 'count') of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an ECS cluster 
-Think of services like autoscaling groups for ECS 
-An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of container services that you can place tasks on 
-Clusters can contain multiple different container instance types 
-Clusters are Region-specific
-Container instances can only be part of one cluster at a time 
-You can create IAM policies for your cluster to allow or restrict user's access to specific clusters 
-You can schedule ECS in two ways:
    -Service Scheduler
    -Customer Scheduler 
-ECS agent to connect EC2 instances to your ECS cluster 
    -> Linux only 
-IAM with ECS to restrict access 
-Security groups operate at the instance level, not at the task or container level
