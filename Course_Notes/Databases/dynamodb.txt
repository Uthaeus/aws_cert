DynamoDb


-Stored on SSD storage
-Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers 
-Choice of 2 consistency models:
    -Eventually Consistent Reads (default)
    -Strongly Consistent Reads 
-A low latency NoSQL database 
-Consists of tables, items, and attributes 
-Supports both document and key-value data models 
-Supported document formats
    -JSON
    -HTML 
    -XML 
-Access is controlled using IAM policies 

Made up of: 
    -Tables
    -Items (think of rows)
    -Attributes (think of columns)
    -Supports key-value and document data structures
        -Key = the name of the data 
        -Value = the data itself
        -Documents can be written in JSON, HTML, or XML

-Stores and retrieves data based on a Primary Key 
    -2 types of Primary Key 
        -Partition Key:
            -unique attribute (ex: User Id)
            -value of the partition key is input to an internal hash function which determines the partition or physical location on which the data is stored 
            -if you are using the partition key as your Primary Key, then no two items can have the same Partition Key 
        -Composite Key:
            -Partition Key + Sort Key in combination
            -ex: same user posting multiple times to the same forum

In DynamoDb 2 types of index are supported 
    -Local Secondary Index 
    -Global Secondary Index 

-Local Secondary Index: 
    -Can only be created when you are creating a table 
    -You cannot add, remove, or modity it later 
    -Has the same Partition Key as your original table 
        -but a different Sort Key 
    -Gives you a different view of your data 
        -organized according to an alternative Sort Key 
    -Any queries based on this Sort Key are much faster using the index than the main table 

-Global Secondary Index:
    -You can create when you create your table, or add it later 
    -Different Partition Key as well as Sort Key 
    -Speeds up any queries relating to this alternative Partition and Sort Key 

-Indexes enable fast queries on specific data columns 
-Give you a different view of your data based on alternative Partition/Sort Key 
-Important to understand the differences
