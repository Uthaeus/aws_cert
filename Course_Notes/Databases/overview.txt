AWS Database Types


RDS -> OLTP
    -MySQL
    -SQL 
    -PostgreSQL
    -Oracle
    -Aurora
    -MariaDB
NoSQL 
    -DynamoDB
Redshift -> OLAP
Elasticache 
    -in memory caching

DynamoDB:
    -Stored on SSD storage
    -Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers
    -Eventual Consistent Reads (default)
    -Strongly Consistent Reads 

-Eventual Consistent Reads 
    -Consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second
    -Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data (best read performance)
-Strongly Consistent Reads 
    -Returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read 

-Scalability 
    -Push-button scaling 
    -no down-time when scaling 

Redshift 
-Configuration:
    -Single Node (160Gb)
    -Multi-Node 
        -Leader Node 
            -manages client connections and receives queries
        -Compute Node 
            -store data and perform queries and computations 
            -up to 128 compute nodes
