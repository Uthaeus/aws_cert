DynamoDB vs RDS 
    -DynamoDB offers 'push button' scaling 
        -meaning you can scale your database on the fly without any downtime
    -RDS is not so easy
        -and you usually have to use a bigger instance size or add a read replica 
        

Aurora 
 -Provides up to 5x better performance than MySQL at a price-point 1/10 that of a commercial database while delivering similar performance and availability
 -Scaling 
    -Starts with 10Gb
    -Scales in 10Gb increments 
    -Up to 64 Tb (storage autoscaling)
-Compute Resources can scale up to 32vCPU and 244Gb memory
-2 copies of your data is contained in each AZ with minimum of 3 AZ's = 6 copies of your data 
-Designed to transparently handle the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting read availability 
-Storage is self-healing
    -Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically
