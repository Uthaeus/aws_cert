EBS vs Instance Store


-All AMI's are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by Instance Store 
-For EBS Volumes:
    -The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
-For Instance Store Volumes:
    -The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Instance Store Volume created from a template stored in Amazon s3

-Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
-Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped
    -If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data
-EBS backed instances can be stopped 
    -You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped 
-You can reboot both and not lose your data 
-By default, both Root volumes will be deleted on termination
    -However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
