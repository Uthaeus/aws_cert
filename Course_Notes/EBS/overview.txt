Elactic Block Storage


EBS consists of: 
    -SSD General Purpose  GP2
        -up to 10,000 IOPS
        -can be boot
    -SSD Provisioned IOPS  IO1
        -more than 10,000 IOPS 
        -can be boot 
    -HDD Throughput Optimized  ST1
        -frequently accessed workloads
        -can not be boot 
    -HDD Cold  SC1
        -less frequently accessed data
        -can not be boot 
    -HDD Magnetic  Standard
        -cheap
        -infrequently accessed storage 
        -can be boot 

-You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances
    -instead use EFS

-Termination protection is turned off by default
    -you must turn it on 
-On an EBS backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
-EBS-backed root volumes can now be encrypted using AWS API or console, or you can use a third party tool
-Additional volumes can be encrypted 

-Volumes exist on EBS -> Virtual Hard Disk
-Snapshots exist on s3
-You can take snapshots of a volume
    -this will store that volume on s3 
-Snapshots are point in time copied of volumes 
-Snapshots are incremental
    -this means that only the blocks that have changed are moved to s3 
-Your first snapshot may take some time to create
-Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
-Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
-You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
    -these snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
-To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot 
-Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
-Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped 
    -if the underlying host fails, you will lose your data 
-EBS-backed instances can be stopped 
    -you will not lose your data 
-You can reboot both and not lose your data 
-By default, both Root volumes will be deleted on termination 
    -However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
