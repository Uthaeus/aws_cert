RAID, Volumes, and Snapshots


RAID 0
    -Striped
    -No Redundancy
    -Good Performance
RAID 1
    -Mirrored
    -Redundancy
RAID 5
    -Good for READS
    -Bad for WRITES
    -AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
RAID 10
    -Combination of RAID 0 and RAID 1
    -Striped and Mirrored 
    -Good redundancy 
    -Good Performance


Question:
    -How can I take a snapshot of a RAID array?
        -Stop the application from writing to disk
        -Flush all caches of the disk 

    -How to do this?
        -Freeze the file system
        -Unmount the RAID array 
        -Shutting down the associated EC2 instance

Snapshot of Root device volume:
    -To create a snapshot for EBS Volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot 

Volumes vs Snapshots - Security 
    -Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
    -Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
    -You can share these images, but only if they are unencrypted
        -These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
