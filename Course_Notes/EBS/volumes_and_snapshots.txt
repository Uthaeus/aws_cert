EBS volumes and snapshots



-EC2 instances and volumes need to be in the same zone 

-Volumes exist on EBS 
    -Virtual Hard Disk
-Snapshots exist on s3 
-Snapshots are a point in time copies of volumes 
-Snapshots are incremental
    -this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to s3 
-If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create 
-To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices:
    -you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot 
-However, you can take a snapshot while the instance is running
-You can create AMI's from EBS-backed instances and snapshots 
-You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly
    -including changing the size and storage type
-Volumes will always be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance 
-To move an EC2 volume from one AZ/Region to another:
    -take a snapshot or an image of, then copy it to the new AZ/Region 

-Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
-Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
-You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
    -these snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
