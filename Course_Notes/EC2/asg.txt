Auto Scaling Group 


The goal of an Auto Scaling Group is to:
    -Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
    -Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load 
    -Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
    -Automatically Register new instances to a load balancer 

ASG's have the following attributes:
    -Launch configuration
        -AMI + Instance Type
        -EC2 User Data
        -EBS Volumes
        -Security Groups
        -SSH Key Pair
    -Min Size/Max Size/ Initial Capacity
    -Network + Subnets Information
    -Load Balancer Information 
    -Scaling Policies
