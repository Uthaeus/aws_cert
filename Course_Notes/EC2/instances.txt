    -you must turn it on 
-On an EBS-backed instance:
    -the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
-EBS Root Volumes of your DEFAULT AMI's cannot be encrypted
    -you can use a third party tool to encrypt the root volume 
    -or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API
-Additional volumes can be encrypted 

-400 series code relates to a client-side error
-200 series code means the request was successful
-300 series code means there has been a redirection

EBS backend vs Instance Store
    -EBS backend volumes are persistent
    -Instance store backend volumes are not persistent 
        -Ephemeral
    -EBS volumes can be detached and re-attached to other EC2 instances 
    -Instance store volumes cannot be detached 
        -they exist only for the life of that instance 
    -EBS volumes can be stopped 
        -their data will persist 
    -Instance store volumes cannot be stopped 
        -if you do this the data will be wiped 
    
-EBS backend 
    -Store data long term 
Instance Store 
    -Should not be used for long term
