Elasticache 


-A webservice that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud
-Improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches instead of relying on slower disk-based databases

Elasticache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
    -Memcached
    -Redis

Memcached
    -A widely adopted memory object caching system 
    -Elasticache is protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular tools that you use today with existing Memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service 
Redis 
    -A popular open-source in-memory key-value store that supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists 
    -Elasticache supports Master/Slave replication and Multi-AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy

-Elasticache is a good choice if your database is particularly read-heavy and not prone to frequent changing
-Redshift is a good answer if the reason your database is feeling stress is because management keep running OLAP transactions on it, etc.
