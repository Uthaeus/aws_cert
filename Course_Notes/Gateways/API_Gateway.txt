API Gateway 



What can API Gateway do?
    -Expose HTTPS endpoints to define a RESTful API 
    -Serverlessly connect to services like Lambda and DynamoDB
    -Send each API endpoint to a different target 
    -Run efficiently with low cost 
    -Scale effortlessly
    -Track and control usage by API key 
    -Throttle requests to prevent attacks 
    -Connect to CloudWatch to log all requests for monitoring 
    -Maintain multiple versions of your API 

How do I configure API Gateway?
    -Define an API (container)
    -Define resources and nested resources (URL paths)
    -For each resource:
        -Select supported HTTP methods (verbs)
            -ex: GET, PUT
        -Set security
        -Choose target 
            -such as EC2, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc 
        -Set request and response transformations 
    -Deploy API to a stage
        -Uses API Gateway domain by default
        -Can use custom domain 
        -Now supports AWS Certificate Manager

*Remember what API Gateway is at a high level
-API Gateway has caching capabilities to increase performance 
-API Gateway is low cost and scales automatically
-You can throttle API Gateway to prevent attacks 
-You can log results to CloudWatch
-If you are using JavaScript/Ajax that uses multiple domains with API Gateway:
    -Ensure that you have enabled CORS on API Gateway
-CORS is enforced by the client
