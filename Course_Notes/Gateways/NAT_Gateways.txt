NAT Gateways


-Preferred by the Enterprise 
-Scale automatically up to 10Gbps
-No need to patch 
-Not associated with Security Groups
-Automatically assigned a public IP address
-Remember to update your route tables
-No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
-Remember having one NAT Gateway in one AZ is not good enough
    -You want them in multiple AZ's 
-More secure than an NAT Instance
