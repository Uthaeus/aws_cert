NAT Instances 


-When creating an NAT Instance:
    -Disable Source/Destination Check on the instance 
-NAT Instances must be in a public subnet
-There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT Instance in order for this to work
-The amount of traffic that NAT Instances can support depends on the instance size
    -If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size 
-You can create high availability using: 
    -Autoscaling Groups
    -Multiple Subnets in different AZ's
    -and a script to automate failover
-Behind a Security Group
