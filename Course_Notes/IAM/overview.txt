Web Identity Federation 
    -Lets you give your users access to AWS resources after they have successfully authenticated with a web-based identity provider like Amazon, Facebook, or Google 
    -Following successful authentication, the user receives an authentication code from the Web ID provider, which they can trade for temporary AWS security credentials 

Amazon Cognito 
    -Provides Web Identity Federation with the following features:
        -Sign-up and sign-in to your apps
        -Access for guest users 
        -Acts as an Identity Broker between your application and Web ID providers so you don't need to write any additional code 
        -Synchronizes user data for multiple devices
        -Recommended for all mobile applications and AWS services

Cognito User Pools
    -User directories used to manage sign-up and sign-in functionality for mobile and web applications 
    -Users can sign-in directly to the User Pool or indirectly via an identity provider like Facebook, Amazon, or Google. Cognito acts as an Identity Broker between the ID provider and AWS. Successful authentication generates a number of JSON Web Tokens (JWT's)
    -Identity Pools enable you to create unique identities for your users and authenticates them with identity providers. With an identity you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services 

Push Synchronization
    -Cognito tracks the association between user identity and the various different devices they sign-in from 
    -In order to provide a seamless user experience for your application, Cognito uses Push Synchronization to push updates and synchronize user data across multiple devices 
    -Amazon SNS is used to send a silent push notification to all the devices associated with a given user identity whenever data stored in the cloud changes
