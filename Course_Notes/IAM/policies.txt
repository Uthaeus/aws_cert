Policies


Inline vs Managed vs Custom Policies 

-Identity Access Management(IAM) is used to define user access permissions within AWS 
    -There are 3 different types of IAM policies available 
        -Managed Policies 
        -Customer Managed Policies 
        -Inline Policies 

Managed Policies
    -An IAM policy which is created and administered by AWS 
    -AWS provide Managed Policies for common use cased based on job function
        -These AWS-provided policies allow you to assign appropriate permissions to your users, groups and roles without having to write the policy yourself 
    -A single Managed Policy can be attached to multiple users, groups, or roles within the same AWS account and across different accounts
    -You cannot change the permissions defined in an AWS Managed Policy 

Customer Managed Policies
    -A standalone policy that you create and administer inside your own AWS account 
        -You can attach this policy to multiple user, groups, and roles, but only within your own account 
    -In order to create a Customer Managed Policy, you can copy an existing AWS Managed Policy and customize it to fit the requirements of your organization 
    -Recommended for use cases where the existing AWS Managed Policies don't meet the needs of your environment

Inline Policies
    -An IAM policy which is actually embedded within the user, group, or role to which it applies 
        -There is a strict 1:1 relationship between the entity and the policy 
    -When you delete the user, group, or role in which the policy is embedded, the policy will also be deleted
    -In most cases, AWS recommends using Managed Policies over Inline Policies
    -Inline Policies are useful when you want to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertantly assigned to any other user, group, or role than the one for which they're intended
