Lambdas

What is Lambda?
    -Data Centers
    -Hardware
    -Assembly Code/Protocols
    -High Level Languages
    -Operating Systems
    -Application Layer/AWS API's 
    -AWS Lambda 

-A compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function
-Takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code 
-You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc
-You can use Lambda in the following ways:
    -As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events 
        -These events could be changes to data in an Amazon s3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table
    -As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls made using AWS SDK's 

-No servers 
-Continuous scaling 
-Very cheap 

-Lambda scales out(not up) automatically
-Lambda functions are independent 
    - 1 event = 1 function 
-Lambda is serverless
*Reminder to know what services are serverless
-Lambda functions can trigger other Lambda functions 
-Architectures can get extremely complicated 
    -AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening
-Lambda can do things globally
    -you can use it to backup s3 buckets to other s3 buckets, etc.

Versioning:
    -When you use versioning in AWS Lambda
        -you can publish one or more versions of your Lambda function 
        -As a result, you can work with different variations of your Lambda function in your development workflow 
    -Each Lambda function has a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
