Disaster recovery deployment mechanisms - 
    https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-whitepaper-use-aws-for-disaster-recovery/
    Backup and Restore
        -Takes the longest

        -Select an appropriate tool or method to back up your data into AWS 
        -Ensure that you have an appropriate retention policy for this data 
        -Ensure that appropriate security measures are in place for this data, including encryption and access policies 
        -Regularly test the recovery of this data and the restoration of your system

    Pilot Light 
        -A minimal version of an environment is always running in the cloud 
        -The pilot light method gives you a quicker revovery time than the backup and restore method because the core pieces of the system are already running and are continually kept up to date 
        -AWS enables you to automate the provisioning and configuration of the infrastructure resources, which can be a significant benefit to save time and help protect against human errors

        Key steps for preparation:
        -Set up Amazon EC2 instances to replicate or mirror data 
        -Ensure that you have all supporting custom software pachages available in AWS 
        -Create and maintain AMI's of key servers where fast recovery is required 
        -Regularly run these servers, test them, and apply any software updates and configuration changes 
        -Consider automating the provisioning of AWS resources 

        Key steps for recovery:
        -Start your application EC2 instances from your custom AMI's 
        -Resize existing database/data store instances to process the increased traffic 
        -Add additional database/datastore instances to give the DR site resilience in the data tier; if you are using RDS, turn on Multi-AZ to improve resilience 
        -Change DNS to point at the EC2 servers 
        -Install and configure any non-AMI based systems, ideally in an automated way 

    Warm Standby 
        -A scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional envirenment is always running in the cloud 
        -Extends the pilot light elements and preparation 
        -It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running 

    Multi-Site 
        -Runs in AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure, in an active-active configuration 

AWS Support Plans 
    https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/compare-plans/
    -All customers receive Basic Support included with your AWS account. 
    -All plans provide 24x7 access to customer service, AWS documentation, whitepapers, and support forums

Elasticity - The means of an application having the ability to scale up and scale down based on demand

AWS Trusted Advisor 
    https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/
    -An online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment, Trusted Advisor provides real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices 
        -Cost Optimization
        -Performance 
        -Security 
        -Fault Tolerance 
        -Service Limits 
    -Core Checks and Recommendations 
        -Available to all AWS customers 
    -Full Trusted Advisor Benefits 
        -Available with Business or Enterprise support plans 
        -Notifications 
        -Programmatic access 

AWS Inspector 
    -Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices. 
    -After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity. These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports which are available via the Amazon Inspector console or API 

AWS Storage Gateway
    -Gateway-cached volumes
        -You can store your primary data in S3 and retain your frequently accessed data locally. Gateway-cached volumes provide substantial cost savings on primary storage, minimeze the need to scale your storage on-premises, and retain low-latency access to your frequently accessed data 
    -Gateway-stored volumes 
        -In the event that you need low-latency acess to your entire data set, you can configure your gateway to store your primary data locally and asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to S3. Gateway-stored volumes provide durable and inexpensive off-site backups that you can recover locally or from EC2 if, for example, you need replacement capacity for disaster recovery 
    -Gateway-virtual tape library
        -With gateway-VTL, you can have an almost limitless collection of virtual tapes. You can store each virtual tape in a virtual tape livrary backed by S3 or a virtual tape shelf backed by Glacier. The virtual tape library exposes an industry standard iSCSI interface that provides your backup application with on-line access to the virtual tapes. When you no longer require immediate or frequent access to data contained on a virtual tape, you can use your backup application to move it from its VTL to your VTS to further reduce your storage costs
