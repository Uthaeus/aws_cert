Once authenticated, logged-in users can only access an S3 keyspace specific to the user. Choose 2 answer from the options below
    -Develop an identity broker which authenticates against LDAP and then calls IAM Security Token Service to get IAM federated user credentials. The application calls the identity broker to get IAM federated user credentials
