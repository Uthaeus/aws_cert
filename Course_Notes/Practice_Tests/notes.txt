With Multi-AZ RDS instances and automated backups, I/O activity is o longer suspended on your primary during your preferred backup window, since backups are taken from the standby

S3-RRS offers: 
    -99.99% availability
    -99.99% durability
    -is most often used with reproducible objects

Updates are applied to your Read Replicas ofter they occur on the source DB instance using asynchronous replication

For the RDS MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, when you elect to convert your RDS instance from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ, the following happens:
    -A snapshot of your primary instance is taken 
    -A new standby instance is created in a different AZ from the snapshot 
    -Synchronous replication is configured between primary and standby instances 

At this time, you cannot have a multi-AZ copy of your read replica 

Multi-AZ deployments utilize synchronous replication, making database writes concurrently on both the primary and standby so that the standby will be up to date in the event a failover occurs
