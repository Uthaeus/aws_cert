With Multi-AZ RDS instances and automated backups, I/O activity is o longer suspended on your primary during your preferred backup window, since backups are taken from the standby

S3-RRS offers: 
    -99.99% availability
    -99.99% durability
    -is most often used with reproducible objects

Updates are applied to your Read Replicas ofter they occur on the source DB instance using asynchronous replication

For the RDS MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, when you elect to convert your RDS instance from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ, the following happens:
    -A snapshot of your primary instance is taken 
    -A new standby instance is created in a different AZ from the snapshot 
    -Synchronous replication is configured between primary and standby instances 

At this time, you cannot have a multi-AZ copy of your read replica 

Multi-AZ deployments utilize synchronous replication, making database writes concurrently on both the primary and standby so that the standby will be up to date in the event a failover occurs

CloudHSM - a cloud based hardware security module that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys 

BatchWriteItem - puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call can write up to 16MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400kb
    -BatchWriteItem cannot update items 
    -To update items, use the UpdateItem action 
    -In a loop, each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed

        -Some of the data plane operations also let you read data from a secondary index 
        -PutItem
            -Writes a single item to a table
            -You must specify the primary key attributes
        -BatchWriteItem
            -Writes up to 25 items to a table 
            -This is more efficient than calling PutItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to write the items 
            -You can also use BatchWriteItem for deleting multiple items from one or more tables 
        -GetItem
            -Retrieves a single item from a table 
            -You must specify the primary key for the item you want
