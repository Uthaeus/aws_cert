Which of the following is an invalid VPC pairing configuration?
    -

Question 4:
Your application's usage peaks at 90% during the hours of 9 AM and 10 AM everyday. All other hours require only 10% of the peak resources. What is the best way to scale your application so you're only paying for max resources during peak hours?
    -Proactive cyclic scaling 

Question 5:
Your image manipulation application allows users take a picture, upload it to your app, and request filters to be added to the image. You need to decouple the application so your users are not waiting for the image processing to take place. How would you go about doing this?
    -Use Amazon SQS to store the requests using metadata and JSNO in the message, use S3 to store the image, and Auto Scaling to determine when to fire off more worker instances based on queue size

    -True 

Question 7:
Contractual requirements mandate the use of AWS CloudHSM as an encryption solution. Application performance is a secondary, but important, concern. Where within your AWS infrastructure should you place the HSM appliances?
    -To increase security, you should place the HSM appliances in their own, private subnet

Question 8:
An AWS VPC allows you to:
    -Connect your cloud resources to your own IPSec VPN connections 

Question 9:
True or False: Multifactor Authentication is required to delete objects from an S3 bucket.
    -False 

Question 10:
True or False: you can write objects directly to an edge location.
    -True 

Question 11:
Which of the following statements about Amazon SQS is true?
    -SQS will deliver your message at least once, but cannot guarantee that it will not create duplicates of that message 
    -SQS will deliver your message at least once, but cannot grarantee the order in which the messages will be delivered

Question 12:
True or False: You can attach more than one EC2 instance to an AWS Elastic Block Store volume.
    -False 

Question 13:
Which of the following statements is FALSE regarding the role of a bastion host?
    -A bastion host sits outside a private subnet and is used as a secure gateway to that internal network

Question 14:
You've been tasked with the creation of a highly available website that serves static content from EC2 instances. Which of the following is not a requirement to accomplish this goal?
    -A multi-AZ deployment

Question 15:
True or False: you can use IAM policies to deny the Root account access to EC2 instances.
    -False 

Question 16:
After setting up a VPC peering connection between your VPC and that of your clients, the client requests to be able to send traffic between instances in the peered VPCs using private IP addresses. What must you do to make this possible?
    -Add a route to a Route Table that's associated with your VPC 

Question 17:
You are trying to establish a VPC peering connection with another VPC, and you discover that there seem to be a lot of limitations and rules when it comes to VPC peering. Which of the following is not a VPC pairing limitation or rule?
    -You cannot create a VPC pairing connection between VPC's with matching or overlapping CIDR blocks 

Question 18:
Your customer is a healthcare company with strict compliance and auditing requirements. As you use AWS to architect the application environment, which of the following services might you use to ensure compliance with their strict requirements?
    -CloudTrail 

Question 19:
What determines the cost of using CloudFormation templates?
    -The resources the AWS infrastructure uses to build your environment 

Question 20:
To maintain compliance with HIPPA, all healthcare-related data being stored on Amazon S3 needs to be encrypted at rest. Assuming S3 is being used for storing the data, which two of the following are the preferred methods of encryption?
    -Enable Server Side Encryption on your S3 bucket. S3 automatically applies AES-256 encryption 
    -Encrypt the data locally using your own encryption keys and then transfer the encrypted data to S3 

Question 21:
You create an SQS queue and test it by creating a simple application polls the queue for messages. After a message is retrieved, the application should delete it. You create three test messages in your SQS queue and discover that messages 1 and 3 are quickly deleted, but message 2 has remained in the queue. Which two of the following could account for your findings?
    -SQS cannot guarantee that messages are retrieved in first-in, first-out order 
    -The permissions on message 2 were incorrectly written

Question 22:
Your company is moving their entire 20 TB data warehouse to the cloud. With your current bandwidth, it would take 2 months to transfer the data. Which service would you use to quickly get your data into AWS?
    -AWS Snowball

Question 23:
Your company provides an online image recognition service that uses SQS to decouple system components. Your application polls the image queue as often as possible to maximize end-to-end throughput. However, you notice that polling in tight loops is burning CPU cycles and increasing costs with empty responses. How can you reduce the number of empty responses?
    -Enable long polling by setting the ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds to a number > 0

Question 24:
Which two of the following AWS Services were introduced at re:Invent 2016
    -Dax 
    -Polly 

Question 25:
True or False: Amazon SQS guarantees that each message will be delivered at least once, but cannot guarantee that a message will not be delivered multiple times.
    -True 

Question 26:
When reviewing Auto Scaling events, it is noticed that an application is scaling up and down multiple times per hour. What design change could you make to optimize cost while preserving elasticity?
    -Change the scale-down CloudWatch metric to a higher threshold

Question 27:
You've been tasked with architecting a highly available application. After building the initial environment, you've discovered that your current security group configuration does not include a port you need for certain traffic. After adding the port to the appropriate security group, how long will it take for your changes to take effect, allowing your application to function correctly?
    -Changes to a security group take effect as soon as they are saved 

Question 28:
When selecting an EC2 instance type for your application, it's important to know which two of the following?
    -The required number of I/O operations
    -The memory requirements 

Question 29:
What is the maximum size of a general-purpose SSD EBS volume?
    -16TiB

Question 30:
Your AWS environment contains several on-demand, EBS-backed EC2 instances dedicated to a project that has just been cancelled. Your supervisor does not want to incur charges for these on-demand instances, but also does not want to lose the data just yet because there is a chance the project may be revived in the next few days. What should you do to minimize charges for these instances in the meantime?
    -Take snapshots of the EBS volumes and sell the instances on the In-Demand Instance Marketplace
