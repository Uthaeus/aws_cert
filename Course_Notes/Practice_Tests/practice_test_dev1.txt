Question 13:
Which of the following DynamoDB API calls does not consume capacity units?
    X-DeleteItem
    -UpdateTable - The UpdateTable API call does not use capacity. It is used to change provisioned throughput capacity

Question 20:
Your mobile application needs to read data from DynamoDB. What is the best way to give mobile devices permissions to read from DynamoDB?
    -Create an IAM role that can be assumed by an app that allows federated users - Web identity federation removes the need for creating individual IAM users. Instead, users can sign in to an identity provider and then obtain temporary security credentials from the AWS Security Token Service

    -You are exceeding an individual partition's throughput capacity, even if you're not exceeding the overall table throughput capacity - DynamoDB distributes capacity evenly across all available partitions. If a given partition is consuming more than its share of throughput, this error will be raised

Question 43:
True or false: The parts of a multi-part upload will not be reassembled until the CompleteMultipartUpload operation is called.
    X-False 
    -True - This operation completes a multipart upload by assembling the previously uploaded parts, and does not begin until invoked. The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request can take several minutes to complete, and your applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests

Question 44:
Which section of a CloudFormation template allows you to set up differing instance types based on environment type (e.g. 'Production' or 'QA')?
    X-Mappings 
    -Conditions - are created in their own property section and then referenced in the resource declaration, allowing for the conditional creation of resources

Question 48:
True or false: DynamoDB supports cross-table joins.
    -False - DynamoDB does not support complex relational queries or complex transactions. If your workload requires this functionality, or you are looking for compatibility with an existing relational engine, you may wish to run a relational engine on Amazon RDS or Amazon EC2

    X-Can be used to launch EC2 instances in any AWS region 
    -Can only be used to launch EC2 instances in the same AWS region as the AMI is stored - An AMI cannot be launched into another region. To launch an AMI into a region other than the one in which it was created, the AMI must be copied to that other region first
