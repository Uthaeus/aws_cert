Question 2:

    -The BatchWriteItem operation updates multiple items in one or more tables
    -BatchWriteItem checks for unprocessed items and submits a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed

Question 3:
Which of the following is an accurate description of the interaction between SQS and an EC2 instance?
    -EC2 instances poll the SQS queue for messages
        -Amazon EC2 instances poll the SQS message queue, process the job, and then post the results as messages to another Amazon SQS message queue (for example, for further processing by another application). Because Amazon EC2 allows applications to scale up and down dynamically, application developers can use Auto Scaling to vary the number of compute instances (based on the number of messages in the Smazon SQS queues) to ensure that jobs are executed in a timely manner
