June 2018 CDA practice test review 

Question 2: Incorrect
A company currently allows access to their API’s to customers via the API gateway. Currently all clients have a 6-month period to move from using the older API’s to newer versions of the API’s. The code for the API is hosted in AWS Lambda. Which of the following is the ideal strategy to employ in such a situation?
    -Create another stage in the API Gateway 
        -The best way is to create a separate stage in the API gateway and then customers could use both API versions. They can still slowly change their usage onto the new version in this duration

Question 4: Incorrect
Your current log analysis application takes more than four hours to generate a report of the top 10 users of your web application. You have been asked to implement a system that can report this information in real time, ensure that the report is always up to date, and handle increases in the number of requests to your web application. Choose the option that is cost-effective and can fulfill the requirements.
    -Post your log data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream and subscribe your log-processing application so that it is configured to process your logging data 
        -When you see Kinesis as an option, this becomes the ideal option to process data in real time. Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information

        -The idea behind exponential backoff is to use progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses. You should implement a maximum delay interval, as well as a maximum number of retries.

Question 8: Incorrect
You have an application that is hosted on an EC2 Instance. This application is part of a custom domain www.demo.com. The application has been changed to make calls to the API gateway.
