June 2018 CDA practice test review 

Question 2: Incorrect
A company currently allows access to their API’s to customers via the API gateway. Currently all clients have a 6-month period to move from using the older API’s to newer versions of the API’s. The code for the API is hosted in AWS Lambda. Which of the following is the ideal strategy to employ in such a situation?
    -Create another stage in the API Gateway 
        -The best way is to create a separate stage in the API gateway and then customers could use both API versions. They can still slowly change their usage onto the new version in this duration

Question 4: Incorrect
Your current log analysis application takes more than four hours to generate a report of the top 10 users of your web application. You have been asked to implement a system that can report this information in real time, ensure that the report is always up to date, and handle increases in the number of requests to your web application. Choose the option that is cost-effective and can fulfill the requirements.
    -Post your log data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream and subscribe your log-processing application so that it is configured to process your logging data 
        -When you see Kinesis as an option, this becomes the ideal option to process data in real time. Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information 

Question 7: Correct
Your application is developed to pick up metrics from several servers and push them off to Cloudwatch. At times , the application gets client 429 errors. Which of the following can be done from the programming side to resolve such errors?
    -Use exponential backoff in your requests 
        -The idea behind exponential backoff is to use progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses. You should implement a maximum delay interval, as well as a maximum number of retries.

Question 8: Incorrect
You have an application that is hosted on an EC2 Instance. This application is part of a custom domain www.demo.com. The application has been changed to make calls to the API gateway. But the browser is not rendering the responses and Javascript errors are being seen in the developer console. What must be done to ensure that this issue can be resolved.
    -Enable CORS for the API gateway
        -When your API's resources receive requests from a domain other than the API's own domain, you must enable cross-origin resource sharing for selected methods on the resource. 

Question 11: Incorrect

    -Ensure that encryption is enabled during volume creation 
    -Create a Customer master key in the KMS service
        -EBS encryption uses AWS KMS customer master keys when creating encrypted volumes and any snapshots created from them

Which of the following deployment mechanism would you consider based on this requirement.
    -All at once 

Question 19: Incorrect
An application is currently in production that makes calls to an AWS RDS Instance. The application consists of a reporting module and a transactional system. Due high load times , the response time for the application used to get very high. This was being attributed to the number of queries being fired against the database system. Which of the following can be used to resolve the response time for the application?
    -Enable Read Replicas for the database 
        -You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica.

Question 22: Incorrect
You have been instructed to use the CodePipeline service for the CI/CD automation in your company. Due to security reasons , the resources that would be part of the deployment are placed in another account. Which of the following steps need to be carried out to accomplish this deployment? Choose 2 answers from the options given below
    -Define a customer master key in KMS 
    -Add a cross account role 
        -You must create an AWS KMS key to use, add the key to the pipeline, and set up account policies and roles to enable cross-account access 

Question 28: Incorrect
A developer is writing an application that will run on –premises, but must access AWS services through an AWS SDK. How can the Developer allow the SDK to access the AWS services?

Which of the following can be done to improve the performance of the application when it interacts with the DynamoDB table? Choose 2 answers from the options given below
    -Consider using parallel scans 
    -Consider using queries

    -Exponential backoff algorithm
    -Retries in your application code 

Question 34: Incorrect
Your company currently stores its objects in S3. The current request rate is around 2000 GET requests per second. There is now a mandate for objects to be encrypted at rest. So you enable encryption using KMS. There are now performance issues being encountered. What could be the main reason behind this?
    -You are now exceeding the throttle limits for KMS API calls 
        -KMS throttles requests if you exceed a combined total of 1200 uploads or downloads per second of S3 objects encrypted with SSE-KMS

Question 43: Incorrect
Your team has been instructed on deploying a Microservices based application onto AWS. There is a requirement to automate the orchestration of the application. Which of the following would the ideal way to implement this with the least amount of administrative effort?
    -Use the Elastic Container Service 

Question 44: Incorrect
You have a lambda function that is processed asynchronously. You need a way to check and debug issues if the function fails? How could you accomplish this?
    -Assign a dead letter queue
        -Any Lambda function invoked asynchronously is retried twice before the event is discarded. If the retries fail and you're unsure why, use Dead Letter Queues to direct unprocessed events to an Amazon SQS queue or an SNS Topic to analyze the failure

Question 45: Incorrect
A Developer is building an application that needs access to an S3 bucket. An IAM role is created with the required permissions to access the S3 bucket. Which API call should the Developer use in the application so that the code can access to the S3 bucket?
    -STS:AssumeRole

Question 48: Incorrect
A Developer has recently deployed an AWS Lambda function that computes a Fibonacci sequence using recursive calls. A pre-defined AWS IAM policy is being used for this function, and only the required dependencies were packaged. A few days after deployment, the Lambda function is being throttled.What should the Developer have done to prevent this, according to best practices?
    -Avoid the use of recursion
        -Since the question is asking us to choose the best option that the developer might have done to prevent this throttling issue is that he should have written a code that avoids the recursive call of the funciton within itself as it is not a recommended best practice 

Question 50: Incorrect
A Developer working on an AWS CodeBuild project wants to override a build command as part of a build run to test a change. The developer has access to run the builds but does not have access to edit the CodeBuild projectWhat process should the Developer use to override the build command?
