SQS


-A web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while saiting for a computer to process them 

-SQS is pull based, not push based 
-Messages are 256kb in size 
-Messages can be kept in the queue from 1 min to 14 days
-Default retention period is 4 days 
-SQS guarantees that your message will be processed at least once 

Visibility Timeout:
    -The amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS queue after a reader picks up the message 
    -Default Visibility Timeout is 30 sec 
        -Increase it if your task takes > 30 sec 
    -Maximum is 12 hrs

SQS Long Polling: 
    -A way to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queues
    -Doesn't return a response until a message arrives in the message queue or the long poll times out
    -Long Polling can save you money
    -Polls the queue periodically
        -only returns a response when a message is in the queue 
        -or the timeout is reached 
Short Polling:
    -Returned immediately
        -even if no messages are in the queue 

-SQS is a distributed message queuing system
-Allows you to decouple the components of an application so that they are independent
-Pull-based, not push-based 

Standard Queues (default):
    -Best effort ordering
    -Message delivered at least once 
FIFO Queues (first in first out):
    -Ordering strictly preserved 
    -Message delivered once
        -no duplicates
    -ex: Good for banking transactions which need to happen in strict order 


SWF vs SQS 
    -SQS has a retention period of 14 days 
    -SWF up to 1 yr for workflow executions 
    -SWF presents a task-oriented API 
    -SQS offers a message-oriented API 
    -SWF ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated 
    -With SQS you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure that a message is processed only once 
    -SWF keeps track of all the tasks and events in an application 
    -With SQS you need to implement your own application-level tracking 
        -especially if your application uses multiple queues
