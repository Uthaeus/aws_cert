SWF vs SQS
    -SWF presents a task-oriented API
    -SQS offers a message-oriented API 
    -SWF ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated 
    -With SQS, you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure that a message is processed only once 
    -SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in an application 
    -With SQS, you need to implement your own application-level tracking 
        -especially if your application uses multiple queues
