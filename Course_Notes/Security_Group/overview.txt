Security Group 


-Any rule you make with your Security Group is implemented immediately
-Security Groups are stateful
    -if you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out 
    -whatever you allow in will be allowed out 

-All inbound traffic is blocked by default
-All outbound traffic is allowed 
-Changes to a Security Group take effect immediately 
-You can have any number of EC2 instances within a Security Group 
-You can have multiple Security Groups attached to an EC2 instance 
-You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups 
    -instead use Network Access Control Lists 
-You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
