VPC's 


-Think of it as a virtual data center in the cloud 
-Amazon Virtual Private Cloud lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define 
    -You have complete control over your virtual networking environment 
    -Including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways

-Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS 
-VPC's consist of: 
    -IGW's (or Virtual Private Gateways)
    -Route Tables 
    -Network Access Control Lists 
    -Subnets 
    -Security Groups 
-1 subnet = 1 availability zone 
-Security Groups are stateful
-Network Access Control Lists are stateless
-No Transitive Peering

VPC Flow Logic:
    -You cannot enable flow logs for VPC's that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account 
    -You cannot tag a flow log 
    -After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration
        -ex: You can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log 
    *Not all IP traffic is monitored 

Application Load Balancer:
    -You will need at least 2 public subnets in order to deploy an application load balancer 

What can you do with a VPC?
    -Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
    -Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet 
    -Configure route tables between subnets 
    -Create internet gateway and attach it to your VPC 
    -Much better security control over your AWS resources 
    -Instance Security Groups 
    -Subnet network access control lists 

Default vs Custom 
    -Default VPC is user-friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances 
    -All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet 
    -Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address

Flow Log - capture information on IP traffic from network interfaces in a VPC 
    When to use:
        -If you want to check what traffic is allowed or rejected
        -Can check to see if the Security or NACL's are too restrictive
    When not to use:
        -If you want detailed packet filtering
            -Use Host Intrusion Detection or a firewall

RedShift 
    -If you want the LOAD or COPY  process to be private via a VPC, enable Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing

Use a bastion host for adiministrators to administer instances in the private subnet
