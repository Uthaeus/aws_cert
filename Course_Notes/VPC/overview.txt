VPC's 


VPC Flow Logic:
    -You cannot enable flow logs for VPC's that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account 
    -You cannot tag a flow log 
    -After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration
        -ex: You can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log 
    *Not all IP traffic is monitored 

Application Load Balancer:
    -You will need at least 2 public subnets in order to deploy an application load balancer
