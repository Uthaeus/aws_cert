-Peering is in a star configuration
    -ie: 1 central VPC peers with 4 others 
    -No transitive peering 

-You cannot create a VPC Peering connection between VPC's that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks
-You cannot create a VPC Peering connection between VPC's in different regions 
-VPC Peering does not support transitive peering relationships
