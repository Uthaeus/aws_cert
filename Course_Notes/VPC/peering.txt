VPC Peering


-Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses 
-Instances behave as if they were on the same private network 
-You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in the same account 
-Peering is in a star configuration
    -ie: 1 central VPC peers with 4 others 
    -No transitive peering
