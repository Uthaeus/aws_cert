Performance Efficiency


-Focuses on how to use computing resources efficiently to meet your requirements and how to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and tech evolves

Performance Efficiency in the cloud consists of:
    -Compute
    -Storage
    -Database
    -Space-Time Tradeoff

Compute: 
    -How do you select the appropriate instance type for your system?
    -How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate instance type as new instance types and features are introduced?
    -How do you monitor your instances post-launch to ensure they are performing as expected?

Storage:
    -How do you select the appropriate storage for your system? 
    -How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate storage solution as new storage solutions and features are launched?
    -How do you monitor your storage solution to ensure it is performing as expected? 
    -How do you ensure that the capacity and throughput of your storage solutions matches demand?

Database: 
    -How do you select the appropriate databse solution for your system?
    -How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate database solution and features as new database solutions and features are launched?
    -How do you monitor your database to ensure performance is as expected?
    -How do you ensure capacity and throughput of your database matches demand?

Space-Time Tradeoff:
    -How do you select the appropriate proximity and caching solutions for your system?
    -How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate proximity and caching solutions as new solutions are launched?
    -How do you monitor your proximity and caching solutions to ensure performance is as expected?
    -How do you ensure that the proximity and caching solutions you have matches damand?
