Reliability 


-The Reliability pillar covers the ability of a system to recover from service or infrastructure outages/disruptions as well as the ability to dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand

Design Principles:
    -Test recovery procedures
    -Automatically recover from failure 
    -Scale horizontally to increase aggragate system availability
    -Stop guessing capacity 

Definition:
    -Reliability in the cloud consists of 3 areas
        -Foundations
        -Change Management
        -Failure Management

Foundation:
    -How are you managing AWS service limits for your account?
    -How are you planning your network topology on AWS?
    -Do you have an excalation path to deal with technical issues?

Change Management:
    -How does your system adapt to changes in demand?
    -How are you monitoring AWS resources?
    -How are you executing change management? (autoscaling)

Failure Management:
    -How are you backing up your data?
    -How does your system withstand component failures?
    -How are you planning for recovery?
