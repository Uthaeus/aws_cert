Backups 


Automated Backups 
-There are two different types of backups for AWS:
    -Automated Backup 
    -Database Snapshots 

-Automated Backups 
    -allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a 'retention period'
    -the retention period can be between 1 and 35 days
    -will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day 
-When you do a recovery, AWS will first choose the most recent daily backup and then apply transaction logs relevent to that day 
    -this allows you to do a point in time recovery down to the second
-DB snapshots are done manually
    -they are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups
