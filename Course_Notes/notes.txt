AMI's are regional
    -You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored
    -However, you can copy AMI's to other regions using:
        -console
        -command line
        -Amazon EC2 API

Elastic Transcoder 
    -Media transcoder in the cloud 

Business benefits of cloud:
    -Almost zero up front infrastructure investment
    -Just-in-time infrastructure 
    -More efficient resource utilization
    -Usage-based costing 
    -Reduced time to market

Technical benefits:
    -Automation -> 'scriptable infrastructure'
    -Auto-scaling
    -Proactive scaling 
    -More efficient development lifecycle
    -Improved testability
    -Disaster recovery and business continuity
    -'Overflow' traffic to the cloud 

Elasticity can be implemented in 3 ways:
    -Proactive Cyclic Scaling 
        -Periodic scaling that occurs at fixed intervals 
    -Proactive Event-based Scaling 
        -Scaling just when you are expecting a big surge of traffic requests due to a scheduled event 
    -Auto Scaling based on Demand 
        -By using a monitoring service, your system can send triggers to take appropriate actions so that it scales up or down based on metrics
