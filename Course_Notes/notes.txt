AMI's are regional
    -You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored
    -However, you can copy AMI's to other regions using:
        -console
        -command line
        -Amazon EC2 API

Elastic Transcoder 
    -Media transcoder in the cloud 

Business benefits of cloud:
    -Almost zero up front infrastructure investment
    -Just-in-time infrastructure 
    -More efficient resource utilization
    -Usage-based costing 
    -Reduced time to market

Technical benefits:
    -Automation -> 'scriptable infrastructure'
    -Auto-scaling
    -Proactive scaling 
    -More efficient development lifecycle
    -Improved testability
    -Disaster recovery and business continuity
    -'Overflow' traffic to the cloud 

Elasticity can be implemented in 3 ways:
    -Proactive Cyclic Scaling 
        -Periodic scaling that occurs at fixed intervals 
    -Proactive Event-based Scaling 
        -Scaling just when you are expecting a big surge of traffic requests due to a scheduled event 
    -Auto Scaling based on Demand 
        -By using a monitoring service, your system can send triggers to take appropriate actions so that it scales up or down based on metrics


BatchWriteItem - 
BatchGetItem -
    -can retrieve a maximum of 100 items. The total size of all the items retrieved cannot exceed 16MB

DynamoDB write operations that allow conditional writes:
    -PutItem
    -UpdateItem
    -DeleteItem
    -Conditional writes are only performed if the current attributes of the item meet the specified conditions
        -Conditional operations allow users to implement optimistic control systems on DynamoDB
One DynamoDB read capacity unit is equal to one strongly consistent read per second
While the UpdateTable operation is executing, the table status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING. While it is UPDATING, you cannot issue another UpdateTable request. When the table returns to the ACTIVE state, the UpdateTable operation is complete and another UpdateTable request may be issued

409 Conflict: 
    -BucketAlreadyExists

403 Forbidden:
    -AccessDenied

400 Bad Request:
    -IncompleteBody
    -InvalidBucketName
    -InvalidDigest
    -IncompleteSignature
    -InvalidParameterValue
    -MissingAction
    -MissingParameter
    -MissingSecurityHeader 

GetQueueAttributes actions include:
    -ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds
    -DelaySeconds
    -VisibilityTimeout

ContentBasedDeduplication is only supported by FIFO queues 

CompleteMultipartUpload completes the Multipart Upload process by re-assembling the parts of an upload

Go is not supported by Elastic Beanstalk

To get a list of all you DynamoDB tables, you should use the ListTables operation 

The Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java allows applications to send an SQS message that contains a reference to a message payload in Amazon S3

The GetItem operation returns a set of attributes for an item that matches the primary key. If there is no matching item, GetItem does not return any data 

ReadObject is not an API call.

Data at Rest:
    -The encryption key is typically a random value which is generated
    -The encryption key is used alongside a pre-defined encryption algorithm to change the plain text to an unreadable cipher text 
    -The key normally has a size in terms of bits 
    -It would be a complex and long value, which has a certain number of bits. 
        -Most common is 128 or 256 bit encryption
