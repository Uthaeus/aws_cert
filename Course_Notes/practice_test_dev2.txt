Ajax, Inc. provides an online image recognition service and utilizes SQS to decouple system components. The SQS consumers poll the imaging queue as often as possible to keep end-to-end throughput as high as possible. However, Ajax, Inc. is realizing that polling in tight loops is burning CPU cycles and that empty responses are increasing costs. How can Ajax, Inc. reduce the number of empty responses?
    X-Set the imaging queue DelaySeconds attribute to 20 seconds 
    -Set the imaging queue ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds attribute to 20 seconds

Long polling allows Amazon SQS to wait until a message is available in the queue before sending a response. Short polling continuously pools a queue and can have false positives. Enabling long polling reduces the number of poll requests, false positives, and empty responses
