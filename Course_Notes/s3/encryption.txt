Encryption 


-In Transit:
    -SSL/TLS
-At Rest:
    -Server side encryption 
        -s3 managed keys: SSE-S3 
        -AWS Key Management Service managed keys: SSE-KMS
        -Server side encryption with customer provided keys: SSE-C 
-Client side encryption


Enforcing Encryption on S3 Buckets
    -If the file is to be encrypted at upload time, the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter will be included in the request header

    -There are two options currently available:
        -x-amz-server-side-encryption:AES256
            -SSE-S3 -> S3 managed keys 
        -x-amz-server-side-encryption:ams:kms 
            -SSE-KMS -> KMS managed keys 
    -When this parameter is included in the header of the PUT request, it tells s3 to encrypt the object at the time of upload using the specified encryption method
    -You can enforce the use of Server-Side Encryption by using a bucket policy which denies any s3 PUT request which doesn't include the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header
