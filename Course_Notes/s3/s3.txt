S3 - Simple Storage Service

S3 is Object-based Storage
    Objects consist of:
        -Key
        -Value
        -Version ID
        -MetaData
        -Subresources:
            -Access Control Lists
            -Torrent

Data Consistency:
    - Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE
        (*can take some time to propagate)


Exam Tips:
-S3 is object based 
    -allows you to upload files
-Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB
-There is unlimited storage 
-Files are stored in buckets
-S3 is a universal namespace 
    -names must be unique globally
    -ex: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
-Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects 
    -once a new file is uploaded, it will almost immediately be available
-Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE 
    -updates can take some time to propagate
-You can load files to s3 much faster by enabling multipart upload 

S3 storage classes/tiers:
    -s3 
    -s3-1A 
    -s3 One Zone-IA
